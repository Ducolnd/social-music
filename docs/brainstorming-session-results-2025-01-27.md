# Brainstorming Session Results
**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Project:** Social Music - Music Producer Social Media Content Platform  
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)  
**Participant:** Duco

## Session Overview

Brainstorming session focused on developing a social media content creation and management platform specifically designed for music producers. The platform aims to help faceless and small music producers create social media content easily and grow their audience.

## Key Insights

### Core Problem
Music producers struggle with:
- Creating social media content consistently
- Managing multiple social media platforms
- Growing their audience and directing traffic to their music
- Understanding what content performs best

### Target Users
- Faceless music producers
- Small/independent music producers
- Producers who want to focus on music creation, not social media management

## Brainstormed Features

### MVP Core Functionality

#### 1. Content Generation
- **SoundCloud Integration**: Automatic track fetching from SoundCloud (primary source)
- **Video Generation**: Create simple short-form videos with:
  - Background image from public repository
  - Cover image from album/song/playlist
  - Background music playing
  - Auto-generated captions
- **Multiple Variations**: Generate 3-5 video variations per track
- **Visual Style Matching**: Auto-suggest visual styles based on Spotify audio features (danceability, energy, valence, etc.)
- **Aspect Ratios**: Support both vertical (9:16) for TikTok/Reels and horizontal for YouTube Shorts

#### 2. Approval Workflow
- Producers maintain final control over all posts
- Options: approve, approve all, or approve selected
- Preview grid showing all variations before approval
- Save favorite visual styles as preferred templates

#### 3. Social Media Distribution
- Auto-upload to multiple platforms:
  - TikTok
  - YouTube Shorts
  - Instagram Reels
- Simple dashboard to view all posts
- Track posting status across platforms

### Advanced Features (Post-MVP)

#### 4. Analytics & Optimization
- A/B testing to determine best-performing content
- Performance tracking: impressions, likes, interactions
- Iterative improvement based on analytics
- Optimal posting time suggestions
- Style library with saved preferences

#### 5. Intelligent Features
- Automatic style matching based on track genre/mood
- Learn producer preferences over time
- Monitor SoundCloud for new uploads and auto-generate content
- Connect with Spotify and SoundCloud for comprehensive music analysis

## Technical Constraints

- **Spotify API Limitation**: Cannot use advanced Spotify API to fetch artist songs or download them
- **SoundCloud Alternative**: Can use SoundCloud for track fetching and downloading
- **Simplicity Focus**: Platform must remain simple - users don't need extensive functionality
- **Local Upload**: Not in MVP scope (most customers use SoundCloud anyway)

## Design Principles

1. **Speed & Volume**: Enable producers to create lots of content quickly
2. **Minimal Friction**: Streamline workflow from "new song" to "social media posts ready"
3. **Producer Control**: Always give final approval before posting
4. **Automation**: Reduce manual work while maintaining quality
5. **Simplicity**: Focus on core value, avoid feature bloat

## User Workflow (MVP)

1. Producer connects SoundCloud account
2. System pulls track and metadata
3. System analyzes audio features (via Spotify API)
4. System generates 3-5 video variations with suggested visual styles
5. Producer reviews and approves (all/selected/individual)
6. System uploads approved content to social media platforms
7. Producer views posts and performance in dashboard

## Competitive Differentiation

- **Music-Producer Specific**: Unlike general platforms (SendShort, ByteCap)
- **Automatic Style Matching**: Uses audio features to suggest appropriate visuals
- **Multi-Platform Focus**: Designed for TikTok, YouTube, Instagram
- **Analytics Integration**: Built-in A/B testing and performance tracking
- **SoundCloud Integration**: Leverages SoundCloud's open API

## Next Steps

1. Define detailed technical specifications
2. Create user interface mockups
3. Design database schema for posts, analytics, and user preferences
4. Plan API integrations (SoundCloud, Spotify, social media platforms)
5. Develop MVP feature prioritization

## Session Reflection

**What Worked Well:**
- Focused brainstorming on core MVP features
- Identified key technical constraints early
- Established clear user workflow
- Balanced automation with user control

**Areas to Explore Further:**
- Specific visual style templates and libraries
- Caption generation strategies
- Analytics dashboard design
- Pricing and monetization model

**Recommended Follow-up Techniques:**
- SCAMPER Method for feature refinement
- Role Playing for user persona development
- Research workflow for competitive analysis
