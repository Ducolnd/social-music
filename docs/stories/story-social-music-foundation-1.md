## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference

- `docs/stories/story-context-1.1.xml` - Generated 2025-01-27

### Agent Model Used

- Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Cursor

### Debug Log References

- Implementation completed successfully with no errors
- All components use client-side rendering where needed (usePathname, useRouter)
- Responsive design implemented with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- Middleware protection verified - existing middleware already protects all non-public routes

### Completion Notes List

**2025-01-27 - Story Completion:**

Successfully implemented all foundational UI components and pages for the Social Music platform:

1. **Sidebar Component**: Created responsive sidebar with navigation items using lucide-react icons. Implemented active state highlighting with purple gradient background for current page.

2. **Header Component**: Built header with Social Music logo and logout button integration.

3. **Footer Component**: Added footer with social media links (Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube) using icons.

4. **Dashboard Layout**: Created dashboard layout with sidebar, header, main content area, and footer in a flex-based responsive structure.

5. **Dashboard Pages**: 
   - Home page with welcome message and quick stats placeholder cards
   - Video Generation placeholder page with coming soon message
   - Posts Management placeholder page with coming soon message

6. **Landing Page**: Updated with modern hero section, features showcase, and call-to-action button. Includes gradient backgrounds and responsive grid layout.

7. **Route Protection**: Verified middleware.ts protects /dashboard/* routes - existing middleware configuration already redirects unauthenticated users to login.

8. **Responsive Design**: All components use Tailwind CSS responsive utilities (md:, lg: breakpoints) for mobile and desktop views.

9. **Navigation**: Sidebar navigation uses Next.js Link components and highlights active routes using usePathname hook.

**Testing**: Manual testing recommended for responsive design validation. No automated test infrastructure configured in project.
